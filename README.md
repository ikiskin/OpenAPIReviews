### NeurIPS 2021 Dataset and Benchmark Track Round 2

This [colab notebook](https://github.com/ikiskin/OpenAPIReviews/blob/master/NeurIPSOpenReviewDatasetAndBenchmarksRound2.ipynb) supports OpenReview API review processes. This particular notebook is using the API for NeurIPS 2021 Dataset and Benchmark Track (rounds 1 and 2).

The invitation code for it is `NeurIPS.cc/2021/Track/Datasets_and_Benchmarks/Round2/`.

The call for papers can be found here: https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks.

If you wish to embellish the notebook and add much more functionality, I would advise you to check out this excellent repository:

Watch the mean paper mark rise as reviewers ignore your rebuttals and your paper slips below the acceptance threshold! In all seriousness, engagement in Round 2 of this track appears to have been excellent, for which reviewers and area chairs can be applauded.

Some basic summary statistics:

* **Mean mark before rebuttals: 5.5**

* **Mean mark after rebuttals: 5.8**

* Total number of submissions (not withdrawn): 254
